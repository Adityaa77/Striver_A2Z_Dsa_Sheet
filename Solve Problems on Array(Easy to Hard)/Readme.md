⚠️ Important Note:
The folder structure (Easy, Medium, Hard) is based on the Striver Sheet's sectioning, not LeetCode's official difficulty level.
Some problems marked as "Easy" in this repo may be labeled as "Medium" or "Hard" on LeetCode (and vice versa).
This is intentional, as I follow the StriverSheet roadmap.
